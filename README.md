# Soundboard Project 🎵

A simple, fun, and easy-to-use soundboard application built with OpenGL.  
It plays `.wav` files from the same directory and displays them in a neat grid.

## ✨ Features

-   **Dynamic Grid Layout**: Sound tiles are arranged in a responsive grid.
-   **Visual Feedback**: See playback progress and get hover effects on tiles.
-   **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically detects new `.wav` files added to the directory.
-   **Scrolling Text**: Long filenames scroll like a marquee when you hover over them.
-   **Easy to Build**: Comes with simple scripts for installation and building.

## 📋 Prerequisites

-   **Clang compiler**: Install via [LLVM](https://llvm.org/builds/) or Visual Studio Build Tools.
-   **Git**: For cloning vcpkg.
-   **Windows OS**: The project uses Windows-specific APIs.
-   An **Internet connection** for downloading dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, run the installation script. This will download and set up all the necessary libraries.

```cmd
install.bat
```

This script will:
-   Clone and bootstrap the **vcpkg** package manager.
-   Install **GLFW** (for window management) and **GLEW** (for OpenGL extensions).
-   Download `dirent.h` for directory operations on Windows.

### 2. Build the Project

Next, compile the project using the build script.

```cmd
build.bat
```

This will compile the project using Clang with static linking and create `build/soundboard.exe`.  
Because it's statically linked, you don't need to worry about any extra DLL files!

### 3. Run the Application

Finally, run the executable from the `build` directory.

```cmd
cd build
soundboard.exe
```

## 🎧 Usage

-   Place your `.wav` files in the `build` directory alongside the executable.
-   The application will automatically find them and create clickable tiles.
-   Click on a tile to play the sound.
-   Use your mouse wheel to scroll if you have a lot of sounds.
-   Click the "Refresh" button to manually rescan for new sounds.

## 🔗 Dependencies

-   **GLFW**: A cross-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts.
-   **GLEW**: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library for managing OpenGL extensions.
-   **dirent.h**: A header for POSIX directory operations on Windows.
-   **Windows API**: Used for sound playback (`PlaySound`) and filesystem events.
-   **vcpkg**: Microsoft's C++ package manager, used for easy dependency management.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

-   **Build fails?** Make sure Clang is installed and its `bin` directory is in your system's PATH.
-   **vcpkg fails?** Ensure Git is installed and accessible from your terminal.
-   **Dependencies fail to download?** Check your internet connection.
-   **No sounds appear?** Make sure your `.wav` files are in the `build` directory where you run the executable.
